### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a simple and consistent commit message format:
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

Longer description (if needed)

Closes: #issue-number

- Provide a clear description of what your pull request does.
- Link to any relevant issues or discussions.
- Follow the coding standards of the project.

### Creating a new widget

When creating a new widget:

- Create a new file under widgets directory, and code on the file
- The widget class name should have `Widget` label for sake of consistency. Ex. `XXXWidget`, `YYYWidget`
- Export the widget in `__init__.py`
- Create widget config options on `widget_config.py` and add default config on `config.py`
- Also add the schema definitions on `tsumiki.schema.json` for autocompletions
- Run `python doc_gen.py` to generate the documentation for the widgets
